This App was developed by :

as a part of Yahoo Hack U! at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.

Usage of GeoGrabber
===================
The App is used to fetch results in the form of Flickr photos and Twitter tweets depending upon the location entered in a elegant Masonry UI. As Twitter and Flickr uses Geotagging, hence we thought of implementing it.
